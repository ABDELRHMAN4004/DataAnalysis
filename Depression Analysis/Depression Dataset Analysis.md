## üöÄ Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Depression Dataset**, which contains information on **demographics, lifestyle, health history, and chronic medical conditions**.  
The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights related to mental health, lifestyle, and income.  
This project demonstrates **data preprocessing, descriptive & exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling skills**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze and summarize key demographic and lifestyle trends.  
- Explore the impact of lifestyle factors on mental health and income.  
- Identify relationships between health behaviors and chronic conditions.  
- Apply machine learning techniques (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost) for predictive modeling.  
- Present findings in a clear, actionable, and professional format.

## üü© Descriptive Analysis

**Key Questions:**
1. What is the average, minimum, and maximum age in the dataset?  
2. Which marital status category is the most common?  
3. How is the distribution of education levels among individuals?  
4. What percentage of individuals are smokers vs non-smokers?  
5. What is the average fixed income across all records?  
6. Which physical activity level is the most frequent?  
7. What proportion of individuals have a history of mental illness?  
8. What is the relationship between the number of children and average income?  
9. Do sleep patterns vary significantly across different age groups?  
10. What percentage of individuals have chronic medical conditions?

## üü® Exploratory Analysis

**Key Questions:**
1. Does education level affect income?  
2. Do married individuals have higher income than single individuals?  
3. Is there a relationship between smoking and chronic medical conditions?  
4. Do physically active people tend to have healthier dietary habits?  
5. Are people with poor sleep patterns more likely to have a history of mental illness?  
6. Do individuals with a family history of depression show different lifestyle patterns or lower income?  
7. Does the number of children influence sleep patterns or physical activity?  
8. Is alcohol consumption different across education levels?  
9. What is the relationship between employment status and fixed income?  
10. Is there a connection between dietary habits and general health conditions?
